NodeRED RESTful API Services MockUp SKELETON for HTTP Verbs

![Title](./images/title.jpg)

This project was developed as a POC in order to demonstrate the utility of Node-RED to make RESTful Services.

This project includes all the definitions necessary to describe the action flows that support RESTful operations on the following 
HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

To use the project, copy the contents of the JSON file in a new NODE-RED blank flow and deploy it. This repository also includes 
a POSTMAN project to test all the RESTful API operations defined in Node-RED.

Finally, use the following commands if you don´t have installed Node-RED in Node.JS.

npm install express --save
npm install cors --save
npm install body-parser --save

npm install -g node-red
